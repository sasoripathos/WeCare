# Team 3 - Team Newcomer
We are Team Newcomer! Our goals for this project are to learn how to work efficiently in a fast-paced environment, how to work professionally on a real project, hopefully expose ourselves to some new technologies, and of course, to get a good mark! Through the incremental progression on this project, we will strive to gain a solid understanding on how to both develop & deliver software effectively.
